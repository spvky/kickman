# Pell (Irish for Gaelic Football)

Cute little black fae kid with an afro


# Tutorial
    * Basic jumping tutorial
    * Basic kicking tutorial
    * Wall jump/bounce jump tutorial
    * Need a mechanism to return the ball to the player to avoid soft locks
    * No tutorial for headers, but make it clear that can header the ball by having it bounce off of their head
    * Find the striker badge
    * Next room, show button prompt for recalling, player then has to kick ball to a button that raises a bridge, and drops it when recalling
    * Let player out into the open world

# Starting Movement
 * Mid air kicks stall momentum briefly

# Generic Upgrades
 * Dash, silk song style
 * Slide, each ball type reacts to it differently
 * Wall jump

# Badges
 Each badge has different ball mechanics and serve as the main method of traversal

 ## Strikers Badge
 Default moveset, first item is finding this badge which unlocks recalling the ball to your feet
 Action: Recall Ball to you


 ## Punished(Sisyphus) Badge
 Make the ball really huge and chained to the player, sysiphus style, heavier and harder to move, use to smash open doors and breakable objects, ball pulls the player when you get too far from it, can stand on top of the ball, refreshing it's forward momentum to ride across certain hazards
 Action: yank the chain to it's minumum length, drawing the ball and player towards each other, can hold to let the ball pull you


 ## Ghost badge
 Fast Straight ricocheting shots that ignore gravity for a while, pass through obstacles and cannot be headered
 Action: Teleport to the ball and gain it's velocity

* Want to start refining the movement
* Up/Forward kicks feel good at the moment
* Unsure about dashing
* Could make a simple tutorial level
* Should add entity support with levers/buttons tomorrow
* Maybe flesh out the bullet time kick I was thinking about
- It could be activated with a button combo and have decently long startup
- Should feel rewarding to find setups for it
- Would be nice to clean up some of the physics code, I suspect theres more branching than their need to be
- Just testing

More deliberate movement, like metroid or sm64
make maintaining velocity more of a challenge
Remove revshot and instead initiate by slide kicking the ball mid-air

Upgrade Ideas:
- Double Jump
- Lantern (Lights up the ball)

Double Jump
Start considering saving/loading game state
mutiple areas
Area title text drops

Juice Idea: Octagonal crosshair fades in and focuses on the ball when it becomes revved
